# PokemonSizeCalculator
Program that calculates the size of a pok√©mon (Generations 3 and 4), given PID and IVs.
It can also calculate Wurmple's evolution (still only for Gen 3 and 4); this one requires only the PID.

Thanks to the Togeter C & C++ and PkHex Discord Servers for providing help for this project.
